abstract = {Variable time delays exist between the driver's inputs and the responses of the vehicle dynamic states during a critical steering course. And due to the delay of active brake actuators, a sideslip or a rollover may occur even to a vehicle with a traditional stability control system. In addition, the unnecessary intervention of rollover prevention controller may deteriorate yaw stability of a vehicle in these situations. To mitigate the adverse effect of time delay on vehicle stability control and to realize coordinated stability control, a novel three-dimensional dynamic stability controller (3DDSC) is designed for yaw stability control, yaw–roll stability control and rollover pre- vention control. The framework consists of a supervisor, an upper controller, and a lower controller. A nonlinear vehicle model is used in the supervisor to predict the vehicle's future states and to determine the control mode and the related controllable areas with active brake method. Then model predictive control is used in the upper controller to calculate the desired tire forces of four wheels under the constraints of the given controllable area; then, the desired tire forces are realized by a lower hydraulic pres- sure controller. The proposed 3DDSC is evaluated with a CarSim–MATLAB cosimulation and hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The results show that 3DDSC can achieve a seamless integration of lateral stability and rollover prevention in complicated steering maneuvers.},

abstract = {In this paper, the problem of integrated longitudinal and lateral vehicle stability control is addressed using a modular optimal control structure. The optimization process of the high level model predictive control (MPC) controller determines required longitudinal force and yaw moment adjustments to minimize the error between vehicle longitudinal and lateral vehicle stability dynamic states with respect to the target courses. The low level controller is designed to optimally regulate torque at each wheel based on the control inputs of the high level controller, and distribute required torque between the wheels via actuation system. The actuation system that is utilized to implement the proposed control structure functions based on all-wheel drive technology that can provide active control of both traction and yaw moment control with differential torque. The multi-layered structure of the control system allows modularity in design. The performance of the control structure is investigated by conducting experimental tests. The experimental tests have been performed on an electric Chevrolet Equinox vehicle equipped with four independent motors. The results show that the integration of the vehicle longitudinal and lateral dynamics preserves vehicle stability in a planar motion and improves the vehicle dynamic response, especially in challenging driving maneuvers.},

abstract = {Introduction: This paper presents the cost benefits of two different onboard safety systems (OSS) installed on trucks as they operated during normal revenue deliveries. Using a formal economic analysis approach, the study quantified the costs and benefits associated with lane departure warning (LDW) systems and roll stability control (RSC) systems. Methods: The study used data collected from participating carriers (many of these crashes were not reported to state or Federal agencies), and the research team also reviewed each crash file to determine if the specific OSS would have mitigated or prevented the crash. The deployment of each OSS was anticipated to increase the safety of all road users, but impact different sectors of society in different ways. Benefits that were inherent in each group (e.g., industry, society) were considered, and different benefit–cost analyses (BCAs) were performed. Results: This paper presents two BCAs: a BCA focused on the costs and benefits in the carrier industry by implementing each OSS, and a BCA that measured the societal benefits of each OSS. In addition, a BCA for a theoretical mandatory deployment option for each OSS is presented. Conclusions: BCA results for LDW and RSC clearly showed their benefits outweighed their costs for the carrier and society. Practical applications: Cost information is a crucial factor in purchasing decisions in carriers; similarly, regulators must consider the cost burden prior to mandating technologies. The results in this study provide carrier decision makers and regulators with information necessary to make an informed decision regarding RSC and LDW.},

This is due to the long time of calculation of the objective function value. For example, during optimisation of the articulated vehicle it is necessary to integrate dynamic equations of motion in the whole time interval. The paper presents an application of own algorithm (EVCA) for reduction optimisation calculations time. This algorithm can be applied to any optimisation methods both stochastic and classical in order to speed up the optimization process. In this paper, articulated vehicle control task has been formulated as dynamic optimisation problem. During this process appropriate braking torques acting on wheels have been determined in order to restore stability of the vehicle. Results obtained from dynamic optimisation using EVCA algorithm have been presented and discussed.},

abstract = {The gradual decline in global oil reserves and presence of ever so stringent emissions rules around the world, have created an urgent need for the production of automobiles with improved fuel economy. HEVs (hybrid electric vehicles) have proved a viable option to guaranteeing improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The fuel consumption benefits which can be realised when utilising HEV architecture are dependent on how much braking energy is regenerated, and how well the regenerated energy is utilised. The challenge in developing an HEV control strategy lies in the satisfaction of often conflicting control constraints involving fuel consumption, emissions and driveability, without over-depleting the battery state of charge at the end of the defined driving cycle. As a result, a number of power management strategies have been proposed in literature. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these literatures, focusing primarily on contributions in the aspect of parallel hybrid electric vehicle modelling and control. As part of this treatise, exploitable research gaps are also identified. This paper prides itself as a comprehensive reference for researchers in the field of hybrid electric vehicle development, control and optimisation.},

A more practical assumption in this work is that the longitudinal velocity is not constant but varying within a range. Both the nonlinear tire model and the variation of longitudinal velocity are considered in vehicle system modeling. A linear-parameter-varying model with norm-bounded uncertainties is obtained. To track the system reference, a generalized proportional-integral (PI) control law is proposed. Since it is difficult to get the analytic solution for the PI gains, an augmented system is developed, and the PI control is then converted into the state-feedback control for the augmented system. Both the stability and the energy-to-peak performance of the augmented system are explored. Based on the analysis results, the controller-gain tuning method is proposed. The proposed control law and controller design method are illustrated via an electric vehicle model.},

This paper proposes a novel yaw dynamics controller for high vehicle stability and handling performance. A hierarchical control structure, consisting of an upper and a lower controller, is proposed to obtain optimal torque distribution for Four-Wheel Independently Driving (FWID) electric vehicles. In order to maintain the vehicle actual motions, that is, yaw rate and vehicle body side-slip angle, close to desired responses, the upper controller calculates the desired yaw moment by Sliding Mode Control (SMC) method. Considering the contributions of tire longitudinal and lateral forces to yaw motion, the lower controller based on Direct Yaw Moment Control (DYC) outputs the optimal torque command for four wheels. By analysis and comparison with prior control methods, simulation results obtained from various maneuvers indicate that the proposed two-level controller is shown to enhance the yaw rate response and ride performance.},

To the best of the authors' knowledge, all the existing control design methods rely on a simple model of the lateral dynamics, which may lead to unsatisfactory results in case of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose to use a modified version of the (model-free) Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning approach, where probabilistic guarantees are given for operating conditions different from the identification experiment.

abstract = {An electronic stability control (ESC) algorithm is proposed for a four in-wheel motor independent-drive electric vehicle (4MIDEV) utilizing motor driving and regenerative braking torque distribution control to improve vehicle stability. A stability judgment controller, an upper level controller, and a torque distribution algorithm are designed for the ESC system. The stability judgment controller is designed to generate the desired yaw rate and sideslip angle for vehicle stability, and the control mode, which is normal driving mode or ESC mode, is set according to the driver inputs and measurement signals inputs. The upper level controller consists of a speed tracking controller, a yaw moment controller, and four wheel slip controllers to calculate the desired value of traction force, the desired value of yaw moment, and the four respective net torques inputs of the four in-wheel motors. The torque distribution algorithm is designed to generate each motor driving torque or regenerative braking torque input for each wheel. An average torque distribution strategy, a tire-dynamic-load-based torque distribution strategy, and a minimum-objective-function-based optimal torque distribution strategy are used separately in the torque distribution algorithm to control the motor driving torque or regenerative braking torque for vehicle stability enhancement. The proposed ESC algorithm was implemented and evaluated in a CarSim vehicle model and a Matlab/Simulink control model. The three proposed torque distribution strategies can be used to regulate the vehicle to perform the following tasks: “single lane change”, “double lane change”, and “snake lane change”. The simulation studies show that the yaw rate error root mean square (RMS($\gamma$-$\gamma$des )) decreased averagely by 75 percent using the proposed optimal torque distribution algorithm compared with that without using stability control.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new slip control system for electric vehicles (EVs) equipped with four in-wheel motors, based on nonlinear model predictive control (nonlinear MPC) scheme. In order to ensure vehicle safety, wheel slip stable zone is considered as time-domain constraints of the nonlinear MPC. Besides, the motor output torque is limited by the motor maximum torque, which varies with motor angular velocity and battery voltage, so the motor maximum output torque limitation is considered as system time-varying constraints. The control objectives include: vehicle safety, good longitudinal acceleration and braking performance, preservation of driver comfort and lower power consumption. This paper utilizes nonlinear MPC to solve this complex optimization control problem subject to the constraints, and the vehicle safety objective is achieved by wheel slip stable zone constraints, the other objectives are realized by adding additional cost functions. In addition, a penalty on the slack variables is also added to ensure that the state constraints (wheel slip) do not cause infeasible problems. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified in the off-line co-simulation environment of AMESim and Simulink, and a rapid control prototyping platform based on Field programmable gate array (FPGA) and dSPACE is completed to evaluate the real time functionality and computational performance of the nonlinear MPC controller.},

They can be decoupled and used to construct regression models of the recursive least squares (RLS) easily. The other is simplified direct yaw-moment control (DYC) system. With steering stability constraints and estimated tire cornering stiffness, vehicle model can be simplified from a multiple inputs single output (MISO) system to a single input single output (SISO) system. H ??? V controller is designed to determine yaw rate to restrain the effect of uncertainties such as parameter perturbation and lateral wind disturbance. By utilizing simplified lateral tire dynamic models and vehicle model, computational burden can be reduced and computation speed can be improved. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the direct yaw-moment H ??? control based on simplified lateral tire dynamic models and vehicle model is feasible, effective, and reliable.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a robust gain-scheduled H??? controller for lateral stability control of four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicles via linear parameter-varying technique. The controller aims at tracking the desired yaw rate and vehicle sideslip angle by controlling the external yaw moment. In the design of controller, uncertain factors such as vehicle mass and tire cornering stiffness in vehicle lateral dynamics are represented via the norm-bounded uncertainty. To address the importance of time-varying longitudinal velocity for vehicle lateral stability control, a linear parameter-varying polytopic vehicle model is built, and the built vehicle model depends affinely on the time-varying longitudinal speed that is described by a polytope with finite vertices. In order to reduce conservative, the hyper-rectangular polytope is replaced by a hyper-trapezoidal polytope. Simultaneously, the quadratic D-stability is also applied to improve the transient response of the closed-loop system. The resulting gain-scheduling state-feedback controller is finally designed, and solved utilizing a set of linear matrix inequalities derived from quadratic H??? performance and D-stability. Simulations using Matlab/Simulink-Carsim?? are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller with a high-fidelity, CarSim??, full-vehicle model. It is found from the results that the robust gain-scheduled H??? controller suggested in this paper provides improved vehicle lateral stability, safety and handling performance.},

abstract = {To improve the vehicle stability of an electric vehicle (EV) with four in-wheel motors, the authors investigate the use of a non-linear control allocation scheme based on model predictive control (MPC) for EVs. Such a strategy is useful in yaw stabilisation of the vehicle. The proposed allocation strategy allows a modularisation of the control task, such that an upper level control system specifies a desired yaw moment to work on the EVs, while the control allocation is used to determine control inputs for four driving motors by commanding appropriate wheel slips. To avoid unintended side effects, skidding or discomforting the driver in critical driving condition, the MPC method, which permits us to consider constraints of actuating motors and slip ratio, is proposed to deal with this challenging problem. An analytical approach for the proposed controller is given and applied to evaluate the handing and stability of EVs. The experimental results show that the designed MPC allocation algorithm for motor torque has better performance in real time, and the control performance can be guaranteed in the real-time environment.},

abstract = {— This paper presents an integrated control of the steering and braking subsystems to improve vehicle handling and directional stability. During normal driving situations (from low to mid-range lateral acceleration), the proposed controller serves as steerability (driveability) controller involving only active front steering. The control objective in this driving zone is to enhance the vehicle steering response by tracking a reference yaw rate. However, when the vehicle reaches the handling limits, the developed controller is used as a stability controller collaborating both active front steering and rear braking. The primary objective becomes to stabilize the vehicle while reducing the vehicle sideslip motion. The proposed MIMO controller, called VDMC (Vehicle Dynamics Management and Control), is synthesized within the gain scheduled LPV frame-work allowing the selection of the variable to be controlled (yaw rate/sideslip angle) and the coordination of steering/braking actuators according to the vehicle driving conditions. VDMC is built by the solution of an LMI problem, while warranting H∞ robust performances. Simulation results carried out on a full nonlinear vehicle model confirm the effectiveness of the developed control system and the overall improvements in vehicle handling and directional stability.},

To avoid the computational burden in finding the optimal solution of the MPC problem using the constrained optimal control theory, the desired states and inputs as references are generated since the solution of the MPC problem can be easily obtained in a closed form without using numeric solvers using these reference values. The suggested method controls the vehicle to follow the generated reference values to maintain the vehicle yaw stability while the vehicle turns as the driver intended. The superiority of the proposed method is verified through comparisons with an ESC method based on ordinary MPC in the simulation environments on both high- and low- {\$}mu{\$} surfaces using the vehicle dynamics software CarSim.},

abstract = {Vehicle active safety receives ever increasing atten- tion in the attempt to achieve zero accidents on the road. In this paper, we investigate a control architecture that has the potential of improving yaw stability control by achieving faster convergence and reduced impact on the longitudinal dynamics. We consider a system where active front steering and differential braking are available and propose a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to coordinate the actuators. We formulate the vehicle dynamics with respect to the tire slip angles and use a piecewise affine (PWA) approximation of the tire force character- istics. The resulting PWA system is used as prediction model in a hybridMPC strategy. After assessing the benefits of the proposed approach, we synthesize the controller by using a switched MPC strategy, where the tire conditions (linear/saturated) are assumed not to change during the prediction horizon. The assessment of the controller computational load and memory requirements indicates that it is capable of real-time execution in automotive- grade electronic control units. Experimental tests in different maneuvers executed on low-friction surfaces demonstrate the high performance of the controller.},

@article{Rajamani2013,
abstract = {The integration of rollover prevention and yaw stability control objectives in electronic stability control (ESC) has traditionally been done based on a priority calculation. The control system nominally focuses on yaw stability control until a danger of rollover is detected. When a danger of rollover is detected, the control system switches from yaw stability control to rollover prevention. This paper focuses on an integrated ESC system wherein the objectives of yaw stability and rollover prevention are addressed simultaneously, rather than one at a time. First, we show that staying on a desired planar trajectory at a specified speed results in an invariant rollover index. This implies that rollover prevention can be achieved whenever there is a danger of rollover only by reducing vehicle speed, since changing the desired vehicle trajectory is not a desirable option. In this regard, it is shown that a vehicle that reduces its speed before entering a sharp curve performs significantly better than a vehicle that uses differential braking during the turn for yaw stability control. Second, this paper explores how the use of steer-by-wire technology can address the tradeoff between yaw stability, speed, and rollover prevention performance. It is shown that the use of traditional steer-by-wire simply as an additional actuator cannot by itself ameliorate the tradeoff. However, this tradeoff can be eliminated if steer-by-wire is used to invert the direction of the roll angle of the vehicle. A new steer-by-wire algorithm that uses transient countersteering is shown to change the location of the rollover dynamics from the neighborhood of an unstable to a stable equilibrium. In this case, a desired trajectory can indeed be achieved by the vehicle at the same speed with a much smaller danger of rollover. This is a novel and viable approach to integrating the yaw stability and rollover prevention functions and eliminating the inherent tradeoffs in the performance of both.},

abstract = {The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a relatively new optimization technique which has been shown to be competitive to other population-based algorithms. However, there is still an insufficiency in the ABC algorithm regarding its solution search equation, which is good at exploration but poor at exploitation. Inspired by differential evolution (DE), we propose a modified ABC algorithm (denoted as ABC/best), which is based on that each bee searches only around the best solution of the previous iteration in order to improve the exploitation. In addition, to enhance the global convergence, when producing the initial population and scout bees, both chaotic systems and opposition-based learning method are employed. Experiments are conducted on a set of 26 benchmark functions. The results demonstrate good performance of ABC/best in solving complex numerical optimization problems when compared with two ABC based algorithms. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Considering that the vehicle motion is governed by tire forces, lateral tire force measurements give practical benefits in estimation and motion control. To estimate the vehicle sideslip angle, a state observer derived from the extended-Kalman-filtering (EKF) method is proposed and evaluated through field tests on an experimental IWM-EV. Experimental results show the ability of a proposed observer to provide accurate estimation. Moreover, using the estimated sideslip angle and tire cornering stiffness, the vehicle stability control system, making best use of the advantages of IMW-EVs with a steer-by-wire system, is proposed. Computer simulation using Matlab/Simulink-Carsim and experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability control system. Practical application of lateral tire force sensors to vehicle control systems is discussed for future personal electric vehicles.},

This control is based on the vehicle yaw rate, rear wheel slip values, and braking subsystem on the front wheels. An optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller is employed together with an elaborate six-degree-offreedom linear vehicle model. The objective is to include the important effects of roll and steering dynamics into the controller design. For simulation purposes, the optimal controller is included in a nine-degree-of-freedom, non-linear vehicle-handling model developed for the study. Simulation results are obtained using MATLAB/Simulink for different vehicle manoeuvres. Results indicate that use of the active differential improves the handling qualities and driver perception especially at cornering situations while accelerating, at which other control methods based on braking decelerate the vehicle not in favour of the driver's desires. {\textcopyright} 2011 Author.},

Since the dawn of this discipline, much work based on different techniques has been published which shows that traffic signs can be first detected and then classified in video sequences in real time. While detection is usually performed using classical computer vision techniques based on color and/or shape matching, most often classification is performed by neural networks. In this work we present a novel approach based on both sign shape and color which uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for detection. Remarkably, a single fitness function can be used both to detect a sign belonging to a certain category and, at the same time, to estimate its actual position with respect to the camera reference frame. To speed up execution times, the algorithm exploits the parallelism offered by modern graphics cards and, in particular, the CUDATM architecture by nVIDIA. The effectiveness of the approach has been assessed on a synthetic video sequence, which has been successfully processed in real time at full frame rate.},

A fuzzy-rule-based control algorithm is proposed, which generates the direct yaw moment to compensate for the errors of the sideslip angle and yaw rate. Performance of the vehicle stability control algorithm is evaluated using ADAMS and MATLAB Simulink cosimulations. HEV chassis elements such as the tires, suspension system, and steering system are modeled to describe the vehicle's dynamic behavior in more detail using ADAMS, whereas HEV power train elements such as the engine, motor, battery, and transmission are modeled using MATLAB Simulink with the control algorithm. It is found from the simulation results that the driving and regenerative braking at the rear motor is able to provide improved stability. In addition, better performance can be achieved by applying the driving and regenerative braking control, as well as EHB control.},

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a simple, reliable, and efficient optimization algorithm. However, it suffers from a weakness, losing the efficiency over optimization of noisy problems. In many real-word optimization problems we are faced with noisy environments. This paper presents a new algorithm to improve the efficiency of PSO to cope with noisy optimization problems. It employs opposition-based learning for swarm initialization, generation jumping, and also improving swarm's best member. A set of commonly used benchmark functions is employed for experimental verification, and the results show clearly the new algorithm outperforms PSO in terms of convergence speed and global search ability.},

abstract = {A Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) system is developed for tracking desired vehicle behavior. The cascade structure of control system consists of yaw moment major controller and wheel slip minor controller. The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) theory is exploited for yaw moment controller and the sliding mode theory is applied for wheel slip controller design. The use of yaw moment control was investigated by regulating the wheel slip ratio for improving handling and stability of vehicle. The performance of the control system is evaluated under various emergency maneuvers and road conditions through pure computer simulations and Hardware In-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) system. The results indicate the proposed system can significantly improve vehicle stability for active safety. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, novel direct yaw-moment control (DYC) with road condition estimation and anti-slip control is proposed for electric vehicles. An inner-loop observer controls the vehicle traction, and an outer-loop controller stabilizes the yawing motion. An immeasurable parameter known as cornering stiffness is estimated from the detected yaw-rate, steering angle, wheel speed and yaw-moment observer output in real time. Thus, the accurate control input can be generated with the estimated parameters. The proposed adaptive control is compared with a conventional robust control on dry and snowy terrain conditions. The experimental results show that the yaw-rate error is properly attenuated by the proposed control algorithm.},

@article{Riget2002,
abstract = {The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is a new population based search strat- egy, which has exhibited good performance on well-known numerical test problems. How- ever, on strongly multi-modal test problems the PSO tends to suffer from premature convergence. This is due to a decrease of diversity in search space that leads to a to- tal implosion and ultimately fitness stagnation of the swarm. An accepted hypothesis is that maintenance of high diversity is crucial for preventing premature convergence in multi-modal optimization. We introduce the attractive and repulsive PSO (ARPSO) in trying to overcome the problem of premature convergence. It uses a diversity measure to control the swarm. The result is an algorithm that alternates between phases of attraction and repulsion. The performance of the ARPSO is compared to a basic PSO (bPSO) and a genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that the ARPSO prevents premature convergence to a high degree, but still keeps a rapid convergence like the basic PSO. Thus, it clearly outperforms the basic PSO as well as the implemented GA in multi-modal optimization.},

@article{Mayne2000,
abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},
